                  The second released iPhone was the iPhone 3G. Apple marketed it as "twice as fast at half the price."

                    Following the very first iPhone, the iPhone 3G had the same 3.5-inch screen at 320x480 and 163ppi as the first. In order to support 3G UMTS/HSPA networks, the team at Apple updated the cellular radio significantly, causing “a much faster theoretical download speed of 3.6 mbps” (Ritchie). Steve Jobs claimed that his 3G was faster and rendered a better version of the web than competitors’, such as the Nokia N95 and Palm Treo 750. Apple kept the Dock connecter, but they altered some of the pins so it wouldn’t support charging over FireWire, which previously would render some accessories as incompatible. The Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR and 802.11 b/g Wi-Fi remained the same, but an assisted global positioning system chip was added to allow for more precise location services. 
                    The iPhone 3G wasn’t considered a full, next generation update but a second version of the first model. This was likely “due to the chipset remaining the same, an ARM-based, Samsung manufactured 1176JZ(F)-S processor and PowerVR MBX Lite 3D graphics chip, with 128MB of RAM that was already showing its age and limitations” (Ritchie). Storage options, sensors, and cameras all remained the same. In contrast, its battery dropped to 1150 mAh, which wasn’t at the expense of battery life. 
                    Apple altered the design of the phone by going with a polycarbonate casing with metal buttons, improving RF transparency and reception. The phone was sturdy and reliable with a rounded back. There was also a significant difference in pricing, from the original being $499/$599 on contract, to the iPhone 3G being $199/$299.
